## Real vs. Generated Content

A key learning experience was identifying the difference between real and AI-generated content, such as text and images. This highlighted the advanced capabilities of modern AI and emphasized the need for strong media literacy in the digital age.

## What is Generative AI?

Generative AI refers to systems that create new content based on input data and instructions (prompts).  
Examples of AI-generated content include:

- Written content and summaries  
- Visual art and illustrations  
- Video and audio content  
- Source code  
- Music

Applications span advertising, education, entertainment, software development, and more.

## Prompt Engineering

The quality of AI output depends significantly on how prompts are crafted. This is known as Prompt Engineering.

**Tips for Effective Prompting:**

- Be clear and specific  
- Specify the desired tone or format  
- Provide examples when needed

**Example:**

- Poor: "Write about AI"  
- Better: "Write a professional 3-paragraph overview of how AI is revolutionizing healthcare, with real-world examples."
